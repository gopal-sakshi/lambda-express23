I have 3 lambdas totally - Ohio region
no lambdas elsewhere

`lambda_express23`    Node.js 18.x
lambda24            Node.js 18.x
lambda24_16         Node.js 16.x

===================================================


this repo is lambda_express23
there are no repos for lambda24 & lambda24_16
see the code below

`lambda_express23`      some node endpoints... integrated with API Gateway
`lambda24`              read the input file & upload into S3 bucket
`lambda24_16`           same as above; but uses <aws-sdk v2>
